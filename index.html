            My name is Gia. The purpose of this website is to showcase my life and spread awareness about the importance of mental health, 
            as well as how I get through everyday life with my diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been struggling with my own mental health for several years now. I am currently diagnosed with an unspecified mood disorder. 
            Basically what that means is I struggle with emotional regulation and staying in a wise mind in respect to relationships.
