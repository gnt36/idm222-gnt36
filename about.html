                Hi, my name is Gia! I grew up in a small town in the bottom right corner of Pennsylvania that is one of the two 
                towns that grow most of the mushrooms consumed in the United States. The funny thing is I do not like eating mushrooms at all.

                As a kid, I was very shy. I was diagnosed with selective mutism when I was young. 
                Selective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder where the person will not talk in certain social situations.        
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a third-year Entrepreneurship & Innovation student at Drexel University. My program is a five-year three-co-op plan. 
                I have two minors. One in Marketing and one in User Experience & Interaction Design. My goal in life is to run my own business rather than work a corporate job. 
                My dream job is to run and operate my own microbrewery or brewpub where I would make specialty flavors and drinks.        
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Outside of work and school, I have a couple of hobbies and interests. I like to exercise, watch Netflix, talk to friends on Discord, 
                read self-help books, and I have recently picked up embroidery.
